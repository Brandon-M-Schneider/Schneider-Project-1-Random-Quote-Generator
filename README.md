# Schneider-Project-1-Random-Quote-Generator

The Random Quote Generator displays a famous quote from a wide variety of categories alongside unique, colorful backgrounds.

The user can click on the "show another quote" button to display a new quote while also changing the background color of the webpage. 

Every 30 seconds, the webpage displays both a new quote and a new background color.

Future Commits:
- Have the setInterval() timer reset when the user clicks on "show another quote" and only activate on the printQuote and changeBackgroundColor functions when idle for 30 seconds.
- Have an image that is unique to each quote displayed on the webpage.
- Small chance the same quote/background color is displayed when "show another quote" is clicked. Write code that disables the ability to show the same quote/background color twice in a row.
